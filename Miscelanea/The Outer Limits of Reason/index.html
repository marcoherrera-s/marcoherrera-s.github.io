But one cannot understand this book until one has learned to understand the language and to know the letters in which it is written. It is written in the language of mathematics, and the letters are triangles, circles and other geometric figures. Without these means it is impossible for mankind to understand a single word; without these means there is only vain stumbling in a dark labyrinth. </blockquote> <hr /> <blockquote style="font-family: 'Georgia', serif; color: #333; font-size: 16px;background-color: #f9f9f9; border-left: 5px solid #009688; padding: 16px 20px; margin: 20px 0; box-shadow: 2px 2px 5px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);"> very strange complex numbers in an essential way. It turns out that the superposition, which is at the core of quantum theory, is described by these complex numbers. More specifically, the many positions of a quantum state are indexed by complex numbers. Those strange curiosities are needed to describe our world. </blockquote> <hr /> <blockquote style="font-family: 'Georgia', serif; color: #333; font-size: 16px;background-color: #f9f9f9; border-left: 5px solid #009688; padding: 16px 20px; margin: 20px 0; box-shadow: 2px 2px 5px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);"> By incorporating all these findings, science has come to accept something termed the principle of mediocrity or the Copernican principle that says that what we observe in the universe is not special in any sense.

In 1982, Laurie Kirby and Jeff Paris demonstrated that this theorem can only be proved using such infinitary methods and that although the theorem can be stated in the language of Peano Arithmetic, it cannot be proved in that system. The numbers simply get too big for that system. So Goodstein’s theorem, like Gödel’s sentence, is true but unprovable in Peano Arithmetic. </blockquote> <hr /> <blockquote style="font-family: 'Georgia', serif; color: #333; font-size: 16px;background-color: #f9f9f9; border-left: 5px solid #009688; padding: 16px 20px; margin: 20px 0; box-shadow: 2px 2px 5px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);"> any self-referential system, no matter how powerful, is somewhat limited. </blockquote> <hr /> <blockquote style="font-family: 'Georgia', serif; color: #333; font-size: 16px;background-color: #f9f9f9; border-left: 5px solid #009688; padding: 16px 20px; margin: 20px 0; box-shadow: 2px 2px 5px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);"> Nevertheless, it is unnerving that proving the consistency of the logical systems that are at the foundation of mathematics and science is beyond the bounds of reason. </blockquote> <hr /> <blockquote style="font-family: 'Georgia', serif; color: #333; font-size: 16px;background-color: #f9f9f9; border-left: 5px solid #009688; padding: 16px 20px; margin: 20px 0; box-shadow: 2px 2px 5px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);"> • Gödel’s first incompleteness theorem says that certain statements are true but unprovable in some finite arithmetical system.
