Neither did thrushes set out with the intent of domesticating strawberries. Instead, strawberry plants evolved through natural selection. The greener and more sour the young strawberry, the fewer the birds that destroyed the seeds by eating berries before the seeds were ready; the sweeter and redder the final strawberry, the more numerous the birds that dispersed its ripe seeds. </blockquote> <hr /> <blockquote style="font-family: 'Georgia', serif; color: #333; font-size: 16px;background-color: #f9f9f9; border-left: 5px solid #009688; padding: 16px 20px; margin: 20px 0; box-shadow: 2px 2px 5px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);"> But no one would seriously describe this evolutionary process as domestication, because birds and bats and other animal consumers don’t fulfill the other part of the definition: they don’t consciously grow plants.
